Note on folder naming:
You may notice the frontend folder is spelled as fontend. This is intentional and has caused no issues or errors in the codebaseâ€”it is consistent throughout and functioning correctly.

Current development status:
I am currently working on the cart section and preparing to develop the admin dashboard. The dashboard will handle receiving new user emails after login/signup and allow the upload of new products through the admin interface.
